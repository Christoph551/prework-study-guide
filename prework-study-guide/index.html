        <h2>JavaScript - Gives websites interactive behaviors.</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is the coding language that uses conditional statemenets (If/Then)</li>
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. <b>If</b> a driver on a highway is hungry <b>then</b> use the offramp to exit the highway</li>
            </ul>
          <li>Conditional Statements and loops control the order in which code is executed.</li>
          <li>JavaScript adds the interactivity for the user of the webpage</li>
            <ul>
              <li>i.e. Pushing a button to do something or animations when hovering your mouse above a photo with a button</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A value is considered "falsy" if it is one of the following values 0,-0, On, "", null, undefined, NaN or <b>Boolean</b> data type with the value of false.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>All other values, including a <b>Boolean</b> with the value of true, are considered truthy.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>{ and } are referred to as curly brackets</li>
          <li>A strict equality operator such as === checks to see if two values are equal, and returns a Boolean result <b>true</b> if the values are equal and <b>false</b> if the values are not equal.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrays are not limited to contain only a single type of data.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Strings need to be contained within quotation marks.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be excecuted over and over.
            <ul>
              <li>Useful for having the code/computer assign the values of an array to save time with large data sets.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>Essentially tells your computer to scan each of the individual elements of the webpage to return values in Developer Tools</ul>
          <li>x++ is a common programming shorthand to set "x" equal to the current value of "x" plus 1.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>If you don't increase the value of "x", your loop will run indeffinitely.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li>Code block surrounded by curley brackets defines the code you want to repeat.</li>
            </ul>
          <li><b>Commenting out code</b> makes it inactive without deleting it, just in case you need it later.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>To comment out multiple lines of JavaScript code, put /* before and */ after the block of code.</li>
            </ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
