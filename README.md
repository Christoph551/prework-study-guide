# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

I have decided to make a career change and attend a coding bootcamp. I believe this project to set up a Study Guide webpage effectively taught me a good bit about the basics of communicating with my computer in a completely different way than ever before! I decided to change up the styling and images with CSS to add my own touch on the curriculum. Back in the day, I used myspace.com quite early on and had a very minimal understanding of how it worked. It is really interesting to see the inner workings of how your computer communicates with the internet. Honestly, I am thrilled to embark on this journey to learn more and eventually start solving some real problems! 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

I intend to use this Study Guide as a reference while updating the webpage with new information learned for each topic. There is also a JavaScript function to assist me with randomly selecting one of the four topics to review. This can be found by opening the developer tools once the file is opened in the browser.
